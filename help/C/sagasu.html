<H1>Sagasu</H1>


<P>
<STRONG>Sagasu</STRONG>
is a GNOME tool to find strings in a set of files.
The user specifies the search directory and the set of files
to be searched.  Double-clicking on a search result launches a
user command that can for example load the file in an editor
at the appropriate line.  The search can optionally ignore
source control directories (CVS, etc.).
</P>

<P>
Two optional command-line <STRONG>arguments</STRONG> can be given:
the first is the initial <STRONG>search string</STRONG>
and the second is the <STRONG>directory</STRONG>
whose files will be searched.
If only one argument is given, it is taken as the search string.
No search is actually started, but the appropriate fields are initialized.
Any subsequent arguments are ignored.
</P>

<P>
Example: <CODE>sagasu printf /usr/include</CODE>
</P>


<H2>The Dialog</H2>

<H3>Fields</H3>

<P>
The <STRONG>Search string</STRONG> field is where you type the
string to be searched.  This string can be a Perl regular expression.
You can start the search by clicking the <STRONG>Search</STRONG>
button or by pressing the <STRONG>Enter</STRONG> key in any text field.
</P>

<P>
The <STRONG>File patterns</STRONG> field is where you specify
a blank-separated list of patterns that define the set of
files to be searched.
The <STRONG>Defaults</STRONG> button at the right of this field
sets it to its default value, which is
<STRONG>*.c *.cc *.C *.cpp *.cxx *.h</STRONG>.
To search all makefiles in a project, you could specify a
pattern like <STRONG>Makefile*</STRONG> so as to include
all <STRONG>Makefile.in</STRONG> and <STRONG>Makefile.am</STRONG> files.
</P>

<P>
The <STRONG>Search directory</STRONG> field is the directory
whose files will be searched.  The <STRONG>Browse...</STRONG>
button shows a file selection dialog.  You can also type the
directory name manually.
The <STRONG>~user</STRONG> notation is supported.
A <STRONG>~</STRONG> alone refers to the current user's
home directory.
</P>

<P>
In the <STRONG>Editor command</STRONG> field, the term <STRONG>%f</STRONG>
can be used to represent the filename found in the double-clicked line.
The term <STRONG>%n</STRONG> can be used to represent the line number.
For example, to start the <STRONG>vi</STRONG> editor in a GNOME terminal,
use this editor command:
</P>

<PRE>
<STRONG>gnome-terminal -e "vi +%n '%f'"</STRONG>
</PRE>

<P>
This happens to be the default command.
The <STRONG>Default</STRONG> button at the right of the field
sets it back to the default command.
</P>


<H3>Search options</H3>

<P>
There are check boxes that allow you to determine:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> if the search will match whole words (equivalent to the grep command's
    <STRONG>-w</STRONG> option, or to the <STRONG>\b</STRONG> regular
    expression operator in Perl); </LI>
<LI> if the search will be case-sensitive; </LI>
<LI> if the search expression will be taken to be a Perl regular expression
    or a literal string to be found as is; </LI>
<LI> if directories that are reached through a symbolic link will be ignored
    during a recursion. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
There is also a numeric field where you can specify the depth
of subdirectories into which the search is allowed to recurse.
If you specify zero, only files in the search directory will
be searched, and not the files that are in subdirectories.
</P>


<H2>Result Tabs</H2>

<P>
The application opens with a single, empty result tab.
The text buffer under a tab is where the search results are displayed.
You can create new result tabs by using the <STRONG>New Tab</STRONG>
command in the File menu.
You can also do that with the <STRONG>Ctl+N</STRONG> key sequence.
</P>

<P>
Each tab has a number and an 'x' icon.
This icon can be clicked to close the tab.
You cannot close a tab if it is the only one.
</P>

<P>
During and after a search, the number of matching lines and the
number of matching files are displayed below the text buffer.
</P>

<P>
You can <STRONG>double-click</STRONG> on a line in a result tab
to <STRONG>execute the "editor command."</STRONG>
The default editor command starts the <STRONG>vi</STRONG>
text editor in a GNOME terminal.
vi accepts an optional argument of the form +<EM>N</EM>
where <EM>N</EM> is a line number at which to position the
cursor initially.
</P>

<P>
At the bottom of the Sagasu window is a text field where you
can <STRONG>enter text to be searched inside the currently selected
result tab</STRONG>.  Click the "Find in results" button to start the
search.  At the right of this button, Sagasu will show
either at what percentage of the result text the string was found,
or that the string was not found.
This search is always case-insensitive.
</P>


<H2>Saved Configuration</H2>

<P>
The search parameters and the main window's size
are saved in a GNOME configuration file
(~/.gnome/sagasu)
when the Search button is clicked and when the application exits.
Those parameters comprise the text fields and the check buttons,
but not the set of open result tabs.
</P>


<H2>Interrupting the Search</H2>

<P>
When a search has started, the <STRONG>Search</STRONG> button
becomes a <STRONG>Stop</STRONG> button.
You can click this button to interrupt the search.
</P>


<H2>Command-Line Options</H2>

<DL>
<DT> --help </DT>
    <DD> display a help page and exit </DD>
<DT> --version </DT>
    <DD> display version information and exit </DD>
</DL>

<H2>Bugs</H2>

<UL>
<LI> If the file patterns designate some binary files, these will
    not be ignored as they probably should be. </LI>

<H2>History</H2>

<P>
Sagasu is a Japanese word that means "to search."
Because of a lack of talent,
I have a lot of trouble finding program names that are not already taken,
especially if they are based on English, French or Latin.
Exploring Japanese words proved to be a fruitful alternative.
