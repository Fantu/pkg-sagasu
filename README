This program is free software distributed under the GNU GPL.
See the file COPYING for details.

This program can be installed with the familiar sequence:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

See the file INSTALL for details.  A manual page (sagasu.1) is provided.

Sagasu requires a GNOME 2 installation and a Perl interpreter.


NOTE: if you compile the code from the sources and wish to run
the executable without having run 'make install', then you must
run it this way:

    cd src
    PKGDATADIR=. PIXMAPDIR=images ./sagasu
