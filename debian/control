Description: GNOME tool to find strings in a set of files
 The user specifies the search directory and the set of files
 to be searched.  Double-clicking on a search result launches a
 user command that can for example load the file in an editor
 at the appropriate line.  The search can optionally ignore
 CVS directories.
